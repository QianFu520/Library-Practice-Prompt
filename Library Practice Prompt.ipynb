Please use all variable names that we have requested in the prompts. When we have not requested a particular variable name, you are welcome to choose whatever variable name you would like. Once you have finished your solution for these prompts, you should be able to answer the questions in the Coursera practice quizzes that rely on this notebook.\n",

To run a block of code, you can either select the \"Run Cells\" in the Notebook Menubar \"Cell\" tab or you can use the standard shortcut: Shift + Enter. Remember that you can run cells out of order. This is not likely to affect the tasks that you will be completing, but you may overwrite a variable's value in a way you aren't expecting if the same variable is assigned in different cells and you run the cells out of order.\n",
